WHY Mockup & Chunk?

Hmmm, lols @ the easiest answer, well, it makes things simple!


Mockup = a base *page-dev-mockup.html file simply loading base assets 
and displaying the planned columns for page layout start point. Mockup 
contains links to chunks so as to view each chunk in the page standalone 
during dev process. Also may contain notes related to such in a card below 
said display.

Chunk = a base -chunk.html file for code chunks / snippets implemented in 
page, thus as in chunks, such can be viewed standalone, edited and or 
re-used elsewhere in projects, thus making using a chunks dev process 
mindset in theory slightly handy.


"/DEV/" Page(s) Dir / File format:

*page = page-name
*page = /page-name/

- dev/pages/page/assets/

- dev/*page/*page.html
- dev/*page/*page-dev-mockup.html 

above note: (about: page-dev-mockup.html, this is the base page dev mockup, 
thus we title it with dev, but we don't need to do so on chunks, 
though one could do so if so desired.)

-- dev/pages/*page/*page-navbar-guest-chunk.html
-- dev/pages/*page/*page-navbar-user-chunk.html
-- dev/pages/*page/*page-header-chunk.html
-- dev/pages/*page/*page-aside-chunk.html
-- dev/pages/*page/*page-article-chunk.html
-- dev/pages/*page/*page-footer-chunk.html


NOTE: Yes, of course, we will note that because this is a "DEV" directory 
and there are plenty of development specific only and or repeats of loading 
assets directories and or other space related or other such things, this DIR 
will get large as is to be expected and is only included for development 
purpose whereas if one was to use such as a dist repo then one would obviously 
exclude the "/DEV/" dir files and only include the "/DIST/" dir files.


"/DIST/" Page(s) Dir / File format:

*page = page-name

- dist/assets/

- dist/*page.html
